# Santander MLOps Demo 

![Alt text](images/santander_mlops_design.png?raw=true "Course schedule")


An MLOps demo using Santander Product Recommendation Kaggle Competition Dataset. I chose the dataset for the following reasong. 
- There are relatively a good amount of data (13647309 rows for training data, 929615 rows for test data)
- The task is relatively simple (multi class classification)
- The data are relatively messy and in Spanish, so it is close to real world scenarios.
